Benchmark indices concluded with declines for the 2nd day. BSE Sensex went down 2.58 percent to finish at 30,579. Nifty 50 indexes ended at 8,966.

The Indian markets last saw such a fall in March 2017. 75.2 lakh shares of ITC Ltd. have shifted in a massive trade on the NSE, as per Bloomberg. 
 
Early Gains were negated as the Indian equity markets, which fell piercingly low at a last-hour selloff. 

The stock is off the most important point of the day but sells with gains of 1.9 percent at Rs 150.10.
