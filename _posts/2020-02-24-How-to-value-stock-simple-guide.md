An investor's success is directly proportional to her/his most important skill - the ability to properly value a stock. Expertise in stock valuation enables investors to trade confidently, predict a company's future growth and make stable increments in assets. 

There are valuation methods that can help an investor understand the value of a stock. Some of these methods are somewhat easy to follow, while others are more in-depth and rather complex. We understand that when using these methods for the first time, it's easy to get overwhelmed by the many valuation methods. This is why we will direct the following article to those who are new to investing. 

## The Two Types of Valuation Models

## Absolute valuation
These models strive to determine the essential or "true" worth of an investment based on cash flow, dividends, and the growth rate for an individual business â€“ and not including the same for other stocks of other companies in the market. 
Valuation models in this category include:
<ul>
<li>Dividend discount model</li>
<li>Discounted cash flow model</li>
<li>Residual income model</li>
<li>Asset-based model</li>
</ul>

**Dividend Discount Model (DDM)**
This is perhaps the most basic absolute model. It calculates the "true" worth of a company depending on the dividends the company pays its shareholders. This describes the actual flow of cash going to the shareholder, thereby getting the current value will tell us how much the shares should be worth.

To start with this model, we ascertain if the company pays a dividend.
After this, we try and understand whether the dividend is stable and predictable since it's not enough for the company to just pay a dividend.
If companies do pay stable dividends, it can mean they are well-developed, which is a good sign for us. 

**Discounted Cash Flow Model (DCF)**
In case a company does not pay dividends or if the dividend has an irregular pattern, we turn to the discounted cash flow model. 

What is the benefit of this model? We can use this for companies that pay or don't pay dividends. Here we anticipate for five to ten years, and then a terminal value is estimated to assess cash flows beyond the forecast period. For this, we check if the company has foreseeable and profitable cash flows. The key here is that we can identify and exclude many companies that are small and new with low cash flows because of higher capital expenditures. 

**The Comparables Model**
This will be our backup model. If we cannot successfully value a firm with the models above, we will try and find the price multiples of the stock. A price multiple is any ratio that takes the share price of a firm together with certain per-share financial metric for a summary of valuation. The share price is usually divided by a preferred per-share metric to make a ratio.

Price multiple = share price / per-share metric

## Relative valuation
This model is the other valuation model we will briefly look at. It works by putting the company we want to assess to other related companies. These techniques include calculating multiples and ratios, like price-to-earnings multiple, and equating them with the multiples of similar companies. For instance, if the P/E of a firm is lower than the P/E multiple of a similar firm, the original company might be deemed as undervalued. This model is more straightforward and faster to compute than the absolute models, which is why this is the preferred model for beginners. 

## Where do we find Stock information?
